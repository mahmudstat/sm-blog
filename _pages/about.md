I am a **lecturer in statistics** at *Pabna Cadet College*, Pabna, where I joined on 19 October, 2019. Before joining here, I was employed as a research assistant at *EAL*, Dhaka. I also worked as a science contributor for *The Daily Prothom Alo*. 

I have, with the pen name *Abdullah Adil Mahmud (‡¶Ü‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶¶‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶π ‡¶Ü‡¶¶‡¶ø‡¶≤ ‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶π‡¶Æ‡ßÅ‡¶¶)*, written **three science books**, which are all available for purchase on [Rokomari.com](https://www.rokomari.com/book/author/47631).

Hailing from Lakshmipur Sadar Upazila, I graduated with **B.S.** and **M.S.** degrees from the **University of Dhaka**.

I founded [Bishwo.com](https://www.bishwo.com) and serve as the editor and contributor of [‡¶Æ‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶¨](https://sky.bishwo.com) and [Stat Mania](https://www.statmania.info).

I am very passionate about teaching, writing, programming, and data analysis, and I continue doing all of them.

**Learning** is by far my best hobby. In my free time, I love to roam around, connect with people, and watch sky.

I am married üíì to Salma Siddika, also an alumna of University of Dhaka.
